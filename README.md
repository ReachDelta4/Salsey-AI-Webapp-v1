# Meeting Mojo

**The ultimate meeting assistant for sales professionals.**

Meeting Mojo is a commercial software tool designed to help sales teams, consultants, and founders close more deals. It captures every critical moment of your sales calls, provides AI-powered analysis to uncover client needs, and ensures you never miss a follow-up.

## The Problem

In a sales call, you're juggling multiple tasks: presenting your product, understanding the client's needs, handling objections, and taking notes on key details. Important buying signals, technical requirements, and stakeholder concerns can easily be missed. Post-call, manual CRM entry and follow-up emails are time-consuming and prone to error.
