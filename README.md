# Meeting Mojo - Technical Documentation

## Project Overview
Meeting Mojo is a sophisticated web application designed to revolutionize virtual meetings with real-time transcription, AI-powered insights, and comprehensive note-taking capabilities. The application captures both microphone and system audio, processes it through WebSocket connections to a transcription service, and provides a comprehensive meeting workspace with multiple interactive panels.

## Electron App

Meeting Mojo is now available as an Electron desktop application, providing native desktop integration while maintaining all the features of the web version.

### Running the Electron App

#### Development Mode
To run the app in development mode:
```bash
npm run electron:dev
```
This will start both the Vite development server and the Electron app, with hot reloading enabled.

- **WebRTC**: For screen sharing and audio capture

## Database Schema

### Key Tables
- **meetings**: Stores meeting metadata, transcripts, and summaries
- **meeting_insights**: Contains AI-generated insights from meetings
- **meeting_notes**: Stores user notes with JSON content
- **profiles**: User profile information
- **business_details**: Company information for users

## Core Features & Implementation

### Authentication System
The application uses Supabase for authentication with email/password login. The `AuthContext` provides user state and authentication methods throughout the application:

```typescript
// Key authentication methods
signUp(email: string, password: string): Promise<void>
signIn(email: string, password: string): Promise<void>
signOut(): Promise<void>
resetPassword(email: string): Promise<void>
updatePassword(newPassword: string): Promise<void>
```

### Meeting Workspace
The workspace is divided into three resizable panels:
1. **Transcript Panel**: Shows real-time transcription
2. **Insights Panel**: Displays AI-generated insights
3. **Notes Panel**: For note-taking during meetings

Implementation uses React Resizable Panels for the responsive layout:
```typescript
<ResizablePanelGroup direction="horizontal">
  <ResizablePanel>
    <TranscriptPanel />
  </ResizablePanel>
  <ResizableHandle />
  <ResizablePanel>
    <InsightsPanel />
  </ResizablePanel>
  <ResizableHandle />
  <ResizablePanel>
    <NotesPanel />
  </ResizablePanel>
</ResizablePanelGroup>
```

### Audio Capture System
The application implements a sophisticated audio capture system that:

1. **Captures Multiple Audio Sources**:
   - Microphone audio via `getUserMedia()`
   - System audio via `getDisplayMedia()`

2. **Processes Audio Streams**:
   - Uses `AudioWorkletNode` for efficient audio processing
   - Mixes microphone and system audio with configurable gain levels
   - Converts audio to PCM format for transmission

3. **Handles Edge Cases**:
   - Fallback mechanisms if system audio capture fails
   - Track identification based on labels
   - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

### WebSocket Transcription
The application connects to a WebSocket server for real-time transcription:

1. **Connection Management**:
   - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Status monitoring and user feedback
   - Error handling with fallback options

2. **Audio Streaming**:
   - Efficient binary transmission of audio data
   - Buffer management to control packet size
   - Sample rate conversion as needed

3. **Transcription Processing**:
   - Real-time partial results display
   - Full sentence assembly
   - Transcript storage and retrieval

### Meeting State Management
The `useMeetingState` hook manages the complete meeting lifecycle:

```typescript
// Key meeting state operations
startMeeting(platform: string): Promise<Meeting | null>
endMeeting(transcript: string, summary: string, insights: any[]): Promise<string | null>
updateMeeting(meetingId: string, data: Partial<Meeting>): Promise<boolean>
getMeeting(meetingId: string): Promise<Meeting | null>
```

State persistence is handled through localStorage with error recovery mechanisms.

### Notes System
The notes system provides:

1. **Rich Text Editing**:
   - Markdown support
   - Auto-saving
   - Export options

2. **Checklist Feature**:
   - Hierarchical checklist items
   - Completion tracking
   - Drag-and-drop reordering

3. **Integration with Meetings**:
   - Notes linked to specific meetings
   - Automatic saving to database
   - Retrieval during meeting review

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Audio Mixing Challenge
**Challenge**: Capturing and mixing microphone and system audio reliably across browsers.

**Solution**: Implemented a custom `AudioWorkletProcessor` that:
- Processes audio in a separate thread for performance
- Applies configurable gain to each audio source
- Implements clipping prevention
- Handles missing audio sources gracefully

```javascript
class MixerProcessor extends AudioWorkletProcessor {
  process(inputs, outputs, parameters) {
    // Mix microphone and system audio with gain control
    const input0 = inputs[0][0] || new Float32Array(128); // mic
    const input1 = inputs[1][0] || new Float32Array(128); // system
    
    // Apply gain and mix
    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      mono[i] = (input0[i] || 0) * this._micGain + 
                (input1[i] || 0) * this._sysGain;
    }
    
    // Send to main thread
    this.port.postMessage({ audio: this._buffer });
    
    return true;
  }
}
```

### WebSocket Reliability Challenge
**Challenge**: Maintaining stable WebSocket connections for transcription.

**Solution**: Implemented a robust connection management system:
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Connection status monitoring
- User feedback on connection issues
- Graceful degradation when connection fails

### Screen Sharing Challenge
**Challenge**: Capturing system audio alongside screen video.

**Solution**: Implemented a specialized WebRTC setup:
- Used `getDisplayMedia()` with specific audio constraints
- Separate microphone capture with `getUserMedia()`
- Stream combination for unified processing
- Track identification based on labels

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Audio Processing**:
   - Used `AudioWorkletNode` instead of ScriptProcessorNode
   - Optimized buffer sizes for latency vs stability
   - Implemented efficient PCM conversion

2. **React Rendering**:
   - Memoized context values to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Used refs for values not affecting rendering
   - Optimized state updates for transcription display

3. **Data Management**:
   - Implemented optimistic UI updates
   - Used TanStack Query for efficient API caching
   - Batch updates for meeting insights

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**:
   - Supabase handles secure token management
   - Password reset flows with email verification
   - Session expiration handling

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Meeting data is associated with user accounts
   - Notes have locking capability for sensitive content
